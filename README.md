# best practices 

This repository demonstrates how to use best practices when writing source code. The specific features demonstrated here are :

1) The use of docstrings and comments for documentation of functions, programs and specific blocks of code

2) The use of a parser to read user input from the command line instead of sys.argv[]

3) The proper use of whitespaces, indentation and blank lines that will make your code PEP8 compatible

4) The use of the try,except error handling method for reading files and converting values from one type to    
   another
   
5) How to write code using functions that do only one thing, and calling other functions within functions if 
   a function needs to do more than one thing. 

6) The use of a main() function in programs that contain code in functions and code that needs to be executed   
   every time you call the program.
