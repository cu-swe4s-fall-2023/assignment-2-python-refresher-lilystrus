1) The my_utils module now contains a get_column() function that can extract the contents from specific cells of a column of a user-specified data file. The extraction is based on user-specified criteria placed on another column of the file. 
 
2) Print_fires.py has been updated to demonstrate two possible uses of get_column() for the case of the Savanna fires and Forest fires columns in the Agrofood_co2_emission.csv file. The total number of each type of fire for the U.S. is printed on the screen with explanatory messages. 

4) The column whose selected cells are extracted by get_column() were originally passed as a required argument. It was later changed to an optional argument that defaults to the first column of the data file. Print_fires.py changed accordingly. 

3) Created a run.sh script that runs print_fires.py
